# Hello there, welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I'm a 17 years old college student studying **Pure and Applied science** 🔬.

I like **Android**, and I'm also a core team member at [@PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience).

Currently, I build ⚙️custom ROM (PixelExperience) for **OnePlus 5/5T**.

**Python** is my go-to programming language, and I know a bit of **Java** as well.

I have been a **MacOS** user for years, and I use PD for **Linux/Windows** VM.

**VSCode** is my primary choice for code editor, and **IntelliJ** for Java of cource.
