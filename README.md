# $WHOAMI

### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Xiaowei/Joey, and I'm popularly known around the internet as **itsjoeoui**.

I'm a 17 years old college student studying **Pure and Applied science**.

I'm also a part of team **[@PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience)** ([Our website](https://download.pixelexperience.org/))

**Android** is awesome. However, I still prefer **iOS** for day-to-day life.

**Python** is my go-to programming language, and I know some **Java** as well.

I also have plans to learn **C/C++** in the future for Linux kernel development.

I have been a **macOS** user for years, and I'm not a fan of **Windows**, sorry Windows users.

**VSCode** is my primary choice for code editor, and **VIM** for command-line interface.

If you find someone with the username **itsjoeoui** on any platform, feel free to say hi!

**Have a nice day :)**
