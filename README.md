# $WHOAMI

### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Xiaowei Yu, and I'm popularly known around the internet as **itsjoeoui**.

I'm a 17 years old college student studying **Pure and Applied science**.

I'm also a core team member at **[@PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience)** ([Our website](https://download.pixelexperience.org/))

I like **Android**. However, not going to lie, **iOS** is still my favourate xD.

**Python** is my go-to programming language, and sometimes I use **Java** as well.

Currently, I'm learning **Django** so I can fill the gaps in my frontend knowledge.

I also have plans to learn **C/C++** in the future for kernel development purpose.

I have been a **macOS** user for years, and I use PD for **Linux/Windows** VM.

**VSCode** is my primary choice for code editor, and **VIM** for command-line interface.

If you find someone with the username **itsjoeoui** on any platform, feel free to say hi!

**Have a nice day :)**
